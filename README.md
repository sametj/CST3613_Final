# CST3613_Final
My final Project for CST 3613 App dav with database Class

For my Final Exam for class CST 3613, students were tasked with retrieving information from sql database and using the information to build a network. 

We were to use GUI to create an interface where the user could give command on what network to build. This command is the processed through sql query and returns all the necessary database objects needed to build the specified network that the user provided and displays it on the GUI.

The professor provided the database and the UML Diagram for the Exam. See Below:
